The aim of this project is to practice a diverse range of technical skills on a topic I'm particularly interested in.

### Short-term goal

* Build a simple full-stack web application that can pull basic sports data from elsewhere (e.g. fixtures, scores).

### Long-term goal

* Build a Bayesian model that assigns probabilities of outcomes for upcoming fixtures. The model will be trained using historical results.

### Technologies

* The plan as of now is to use a MERN stack to build the web application, and use Python separately for the modelling of the data. This is all subject to change.
